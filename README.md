# Tracking selected objects
Tracking selected objects in the image using classic trackers from OpenCV.

## Principal of work
Selecting objects in the image to initialize trackers to track them. Classic trackers from OpenCV are used.

Minimal control is implemented:
- Key S - switches to the objects selection mode (if some objects are already being tracked, it will add new ones for tracking);
- Key C - clearing the tracking history and deleting trackers;
- Key Q - exit the program.
